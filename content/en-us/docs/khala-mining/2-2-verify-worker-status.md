## Verify Worker Status

Check your miner's status with:

```bash
sudo phala status
```

An expected worker status is shown as follow, which contains the node name, number of cores, gas account and balance, StakePool account and Worker public key.

> Warning will be sent if your gas account balance is under 2 PHA so you can recharge in time.
