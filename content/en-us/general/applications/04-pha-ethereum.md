Phala is about to open [PHA/kUSD Bootstrap](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork/status/1506240002367229958) at Karura block height #1697502.

To this end, SubBridge recently opened the Khala to Karura bridge transfer to facilitate users to transfer PHA to Karura. Follow the steps to do the transfer:

</p>

1. Open [SubBridge](https://app.phala.network/bridge/), switch *From* chain to `Khala`, *To* chain to `Karura`, and choose `PHA` as the currency;
2. Connect the Khala account, enter the transfer amount, and keep some transaction fees;
3. Enter the receiving account on Karura, note that it should be the Karura address;
4. Click *Submit*;

</p>

5. Confirm pop-up window;
   > Note: Transferring from Khala to Karura will charge a bridge fee of 0.0512 PHA. This fee does not include the transaction fee.
6. Click *Submit* again to sign;
7. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed, i.e., the transaction is sent from Khala;
8. Then you can go to [Karura Apps](https://apps.karura.network/portfolio) to check whether you have received PHA; if not received within 1 minute, you can go to [Subscan](https://khala.subscan.io/) to check whether you have sent a transaction; if you have any questions, you can consult our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/phala).

The same goes for transferring PHA from Karura back to Khala.
